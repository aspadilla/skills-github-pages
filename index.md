I received my Ph.D. in History from the Complutense University of Madrid (Spain) in 2014. I have published a book and several articles in top-ranked scholarly journals and have presented my research at conferences in Spain, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

My main interest remains in the study of U.S. foreign poliicy in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. My current research builds on my Ph.D. to explore the intersection of U.S. development aid, global capitalism and the Cold War in Latin America in the aftermath of the Cuban Revolution.
